# Sounds

Sound generator for the browser.

## Setup

Two ways to get the project:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:pe8ter/sounds.git
$ git clone https://github.com/pe8ter/sounds.git
```

Make sure you have `gulp` installed globally:

```bash
$ npm i -g gulp
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
$ npm i
```

## Build

Build the project once:

```bash
$ gulp
```

Build the project once and watch for changes to incrementally rebuild:

```bash
$ gulp start
```

Build output goes into `{project-root}/dist/dev`.

## Serve

The project makes no assumptions about how the files are served which means you can set up a static file server as you see fit.
